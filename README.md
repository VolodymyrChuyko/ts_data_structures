Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently

Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:
   - Linear data structure
   - Non-linear data structure

In **linear data structures**, the elements are **arranged in sequence** one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement. Popular linear data structures are **array**, **stack**, **queue**, **linked list**.

However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

Unlike linear data structures, elements in **non-linear data structures** are not in any sequence. Instead they are **arranged in a hierarchical manner** where one element will be connected to one or more elements.

**Non-linear data structures** are further divided into **graph** and **tree** based data structures.
